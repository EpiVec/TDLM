# TDLM 1.1.1.9000

This is a list of changes made in the development/GitHub version of the package  
between TDLM 1.1.1 (CRAN release 2025-03-06) and the next CRAN release.


* Renamed the organization to `RTDLM`.

* Added the `great_circle` argument to `extract_spatial_information()` allowing
the users to use their own projection for computing Euclidean distances 
(suggested by @PleaseConverge).

* Changed the threshold of `Ecume::ks_test()` used 
[here](https://github.com/EpiVec/TDLM/blob/master/R/utils.R#L764) 
from 0.001 to 0 to match 
the standard definition of the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test (suggested by 
@PleaseConverge).
